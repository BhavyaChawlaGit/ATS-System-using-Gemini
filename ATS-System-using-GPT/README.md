# ATS-System-using-Open-AI-GPT
This project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to evaluate resumes against job descriptions. The application is built with Streamlit and allows users to upload a PDF resume and input a job description. The GPT-3 model then provides an evaluation.


## How to Run

1. Install the necessary Python packages: `streamlit`, `pdfplumber`, and `openai`.

2. Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `appgpt.py` script.

3. Run the Streamlit app with the command:

```
streamlit run appgpt.py
```
